# Progress Resident Radio Checkbox

The `Progress Resident` component provides the logic for the "Are you a current
Progress resident" question that appears on both the [registration form][1] and
the [personal settings form][2].

## Usage

The `Progress Resident Radio Checkbox` is implemented as a hook. It returns the
component _and_ the current resident status.

If the user is currently logged in, this component will initialize its state
to match the current resident status stored in the current user's profile.

To use this component, call a new instance of the hook:

```tsx
const ConsumingComponent = () => {
  const [Resident, isResident] = useProgressResident();
  return <Resident />;
};
```

In this example, `isResident` will always reflect the current checked status
of the control.
