# Privacy Policy Checkbox

The `Privacy Policy` component is a specialized version of the [`Checkbox`][1]
component. Its goals are:

1.  Reduce the surface area for customization and testing.
2.  Encapsulate the logic required to manage the "Privacy Policy" checkbox
    as a required field.
3.  Provide a single point of truth for the "Privacy Policy" legal statement.

## Usage

The `Privacy Policy Checkbox` is implemented as a hook. It returns the
component _and_ the current checked status.

If the user is currently logged in, this component will initialize to a
checked or unchecked state based on whether the user has already accepted
the privacy policy or not.

To use this component, call a new instance of the hook:

```tsx
const ConsumingComponent = () => {
  const [PrivacyPolicy, isAccepted] = usePrivacyPolicyCheckbox();
  return <PrivacyPolicy />;
};
```

In this example, `isAccepted` will always reflect the current checked status
of the control.
