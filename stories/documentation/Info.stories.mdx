## Documentation Addons

### üî§ Docs

Storybook's Docs addon comes out of the box with Storybook and is pretty
customizable, especially when using MDX content. You are able to import
Storybook components straight into your MDX file, allowing you to quickly
write documentation and include necessary references.

**A few features:**

- Automatically creates a DocsPage that aggregates info from stories, text descriptions, props tables, and code examples
- Ability to customize documentation
- Ability to import Storybook components into MDX files

To view the Docs page, navigate to the `Docs` tab (next to the `Canvas` tab in the main toolbar)

## Design/UI Addons

### ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility

The Accessibility addon helps you develop accessible components.

_Note_: If you toggle between dark and light backgrounds, Accessibility does not always automatically refresh and list violations.
A current workaround is to click on a different addon tab (i.e. Design or Actions) after changing the background and click back into
Accessibility to view any violations and warnings.

**A few features:**

- Provides suggestions on how to fix violations
- Notes the specific standard that is being violated
- Ability to disable/override rules, if needed
- Visually highlights specific elements are in violation

Available on all components under `Canvas` > `Accessibility` (in the sidebar)

### üî≤ Outline

It's all in the name: Outline _outlines_ CSS elements to help with layout placement and alignment.

**A few features:**

- Visually debug CSS layout and alignment
- Specifically outlines individual elements

Toggle the Outline tool by clicking on the `Outline` icon with the `Canvas` tab selected.

### üèû Backgrounds

Switch backgrounds to view components in different settings.

**A few features:**

- Customize background colors
- Background colors can be solid or gradients
- No support for background images

  backgrounds: {
    values: [
      {
        name: 'color name',
        value: 'rgb(251,244,244)',
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

  <Field.Label>
    Textarea
